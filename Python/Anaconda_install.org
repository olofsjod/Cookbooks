1. Download the anaconda installation script from
[[https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux]].

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the installation script with ~cd~.

3. Run the installation script (i.e. ~bash Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh~)

4. Agree to the license terms.

5. Choose installation path. (Tip: add a dot to the directory name in order to
   make it hidden, apparently this cannot be changed easily after installation).

6. Say "yes" to initialize anaconda3 by running conda init to modify the shell
   scripts.

7. Restart terminal.
